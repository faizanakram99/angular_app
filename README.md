# angular_app
**My first Angular Application. It will contains these features**
- A single sign-on screen with key principle of authentication.
- After successful sign-up it should take user to main page of application.
- In the next stage you can add more screens. for e.g.,register  with basic information such as first name, fathers name, DOB, Email etc.
- Finally user should be asked to accept the terms and conditions.
- User should be able to view his profile.
